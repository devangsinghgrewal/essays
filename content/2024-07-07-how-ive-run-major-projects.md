Running an ambitious project is like guiding a rocket: you can't see every perturbation ahead of time, so you need short feedback cycles, clear telemetry, and decisive course-corrections.

## Maintain a detailed plan for victory

Describe the end-state in excruciating detail. If you can't picture the finish line, your team can't either. 

## Run a fast OODA loop

Observe, Orient, Decide, Act ... faster than reality changes. The shorter your loop, the less error accumulates.

## Overcommunicate

Your teammates can't read your mind. The cost of repeating yourself is tiny compared to the cost of silent misalignment.

## Break off sub-projects

A project is a tree of blockers. Parallelize the branches.

## Have fun

Momentum is a function of morale.
