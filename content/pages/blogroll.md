Title: Blogroll
Date: 2024-07-07

Below are sites, newsletters, and archives that consistently teach me something new about AI, programming, or living well.  I try to keep the list short; everything here has earned a permanent tab in my RSS reader.

* **[Paul Graham Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/)** — timeless reads on startups, wealth, and learning.  "How to Do Great Work" and "Maker's Schedule" are classics.
* **[Julia Evans (jvns.ca)](https://jvns.ca/)** — joyful deep-dives into low-level tooling (strace, tcpdump) and friendly zines that explain complexity.
* **[Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/)** — Dan Abramov's long-form posts on React, software design, and occasional philosophy.
* **[The Batch – deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/)** — weekly newsletter summarising new ML research in plain English.
* **[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)** — interactive, visual explanations of machine-learning concepts.  Updates are rare but well worth the wait.
