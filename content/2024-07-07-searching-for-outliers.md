Summary: most important things are outlier-driven • draw lots of samples • filter for maybe-amazing, not probably-good • learn where your bar should be • expect to fail a lot

The world is heavy-tailed. 80 % of your output will come from 20 % of your bets, and 80 % of *that* 20 % will come from a single weird idea.

If you want extraordinary results, you must:

1. **Draw many samples.**  Quantity is the gateway drug to quality.
2. **Filter for maybe-amazing.**  Reject "probably good" ideas—they crowd out black-swan upside.
3. **Iterate faster than your luck decay.**  Outliers arrive on their own schedule; your job is to be alive when they do.

Failure is the price of admission. Keep paying.
