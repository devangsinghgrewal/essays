Everyone has an abyss—the set of possibilities too scary to contemplate. Founders refuse to think about the killer feature they don't have; employees ignore the reorg rumor; individuals tune out existential risk.

But the abyss doesn't disappear when you look away. It just grows teeth in the dark.

## Why stare?

1. Reality is undefeated.  
2. Early detection converts catastrophes into inconveniences.  
3. Your competitors *also* don't want to look.

## How to practice

• Schedule a "fear review" each quarter.  
• Invite a friend who'll call your bluff.  
• Write down the worst question you can think of and answer it in writing.
